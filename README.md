17th placed solution 

Passion fruit pests and diseases in Uganda lead to reduced yields and decreased investment in farming over time. Most Ugandan farmers (including passion fruit farmers) are smallholder farmers from low-income households, and do not have sufficient information and means to combat these challenges. Without the required knowledge about the health of their crops, farmers cannot intervene promptly to avoid devastating losses.

The Marconi Society Machine Learning Laboratory at Makerere University is addressing the lack of a reliable, timely diagnostic platform for passion fruit diseases by developing a low-cost hand-held diagnostic device (based on the Raspberry Pi) making use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

In this challenge, you will classify the disease status of a plant given an image of a passion fruit. If successful, this model will be deployed as part of a device to aid smallholder farmers in making a prompt diagnosis in their passion fruit crops.
